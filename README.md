# Java Problem Sets
A collection of Java programming tasks designed to develop and test object-oriented programming skills. These exercises are part of the COM1027 university module curriculum.

## üìò Overview
This repository serves as a practical resource for honing Java programming abilities, focusing on object-oriented principles such as:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation and Abstraction
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- Exception Handling
- File I/O Operations
The tasks are designed to reinforce theoretical knowledge through hands-on coding exercises, fostering a deeper understanding of Java's core concepts.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:
- **`ProblemSets/`**: Contains individual Java files for each problem, showcasing various concepts and their implementations.
- **`Practicals/`**: Includes practical exercises that apply the concepts learned in the problem sets to real-world scenarios.
Each file is named to reflect its purpose and the concept it demonstrates, making it easy to navigate and understand.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To begin exploring and running the exercises:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toby-sym/Java-Problem-Sets.git
   cd Java-Problem-Sets

2. Open the desired Java file in your preferred IDE or text editor.

3. Compile and run the Java file:
   javac ProblemSets/ProblemName.java
   java ProblemSets.ProblemName

 NOTE: Replace ProblemName with the actual name of the Java file you wish to execute.
